# Gradient-descent
We will use the gardient descent algorithm to find a local minimum of a 2D function, in this case, the Sphere function.
Formula:

f(x,y)=x^2+y^2 

Global minimum:

f(x1,...,xn)=f(0,...,0)=0 

The Sphere function has a global minimum at  ((0,0)) , where  (f(x,y)=0) , making it an ideal function for demonstrating gradient descent.
